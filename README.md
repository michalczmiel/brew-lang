# brew-lang

This is a simple Domain Specific Language (DSL) for crafting coffee brew recipes. The language is focused on alternative methods.

This is a learning project to explore the design and implementation of a DSL (including parsing, linting, evaluation, and error handling) as well as creating simple editor environment features like syntax highlighting and code completion.

## Tooling

The core project is powered by ohm.js and CodeMirror.

I'm testing Bun and Biome for this project for the dev side.
